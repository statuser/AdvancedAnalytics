# Class Purpose 

Today we are working on the fundamentals of programming.  We will pick up with actually programming techniques next time, but today we are going to talk about some underlying concepts and philosophies behind programming as well as how computers as machines work.  This are foundational concepts and understanding of these concepts is important for having computer programs make sense.

# Class Outline

1. Programming/Coding as an engineering exercise
2. Programming is a unique kind of hard
	- Motivations of learning: Opportunity, Motivation, Ability (Note: all of these are can be developed)
3. Philosophy of Learn-Do-Becomes
	- Why each part?
4. How does a computer program work?
	- Parts of a computer?

	- What does each part do?
	- Computers have 4 different functions:
		- Input Information
		- Process information
		- Store Information
		- Output Information
5. Pseudo Code and planning a program
	- Start simple and build complexity over time
	- Understand the problem you are trying to solve
	- Identify desired outputs
	- Identify input and sources of input
	- Decide on the proper level of abstraction
	- The make or buy decision

# Programming is an engineering exercise

What is the difference between an engineer and a construction worker?

Imagine you are exploring the jungle and come upon a wide chasm that you need to cross.  It is too wide to jump, too long to go around, and too deep to climb down.  How do you get across?  Does it matter how many times you will need to cross the chasm or how many people will be following after you?

Further imagine that you find a box of supplies beside the trail.  (Go with me here this is an allegory!)  What would you expect to find in the box?  Would having the box solve your problem?  What else would you need?

You find tools in another box close by?  Is that any better?

You find the plans for a bridge as well?  That is everything you find close by.  Would you trust the bridge that you built?
