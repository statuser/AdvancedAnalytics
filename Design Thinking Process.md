# The UX Design Process

## Class Purpose

Develop an understanding and apply the principles of the design thinking process as it relates to UX design.  This is one of the fundamental aspects of a product managers job.  Sometimes a PM will have a team member that is a UX expert or hire an outside consultant, but the UX design process is an important aspect of their job and it is valuable to have a basic understandingof the process.

4. Defining the problem
5. Ideate to develop multiple potential solutions
6. Prototype the most promising ideas

### An Introduction to User Experience Design

What is UX Design? - "The process of designing great digital product experiences that work well for the people who use those products."

[![What does a UX Designer Actually Do?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3zICP8XADfs/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3zICP8XADfs})


To summarize a UX Designer:

- Works to understand people and the problems they face related to the digital experience 
- Can identify and describe the pain points, frictions, a problems that a user experiences
- Design or redesign a product to reduce the friction and help users accomplish the task
- Design in ways that are compatible with business objectives and constraints
- Test and iterate on different design ideas to continuously improve the product or adapt to changing user and business requirements

The User Experiences designer accomplishes this by:

- Conducting, analyzing, and summarizing user research
- Meeting with stake holders to understand there priorities and constraints
- Lead workshops to create materials that will cultivate empathy toward the user and communicate insights about the customers journey
- Build wireframes and prototypes that reflect the insights and needs of users while aligning with business goals
- Test prototypes to understand how users work with their products to refine and polish the design of the products.
- Work with UI designers and developers to implement the designs consistent with their vision of the product.

One way UX designers can accomplish much of their work by following the design thinking approach.  The design thinking approach is an iterative framework that outlines specific steps to crafting user centered designs.  The process is iterative and may be non-linear as you bounce between different steps in the process or revisit earlier steps and situations and changing understanding dictate.

Steps steps in the Design Thinking process are:

> ### Wicked vs. Kind Problems  
> Wicked problems are problems that are complicated and varied without are real set of either rulers or well-defined outcomes.  Wicked problems do not have a clear set of inputs, lack immediate feedback, and don't have a clearly defined outcome.  In many cases a solution is judges on the "I know it when I see it!" criteria.  This is opposed to kind problems where the parameters and factors that influence a decision are clearly understood and well defined, feedback is immediate, and the rules and steps to improve are immediately clear. This does not mean that kind problems are simple or easily solved. A common example of a kind problem is the game of chess.  In chess there are approximately 10^40 positions created by legal moves and the problem is one of finding the best possible move for any given position.  This is not a simple problem, but if is still considered a nice problem since the rules and desired outcome are clear.  
> Wicked problems are the domain of design thinking.  The goal of the procedure is not necessarily to come up with the optimal solution, but rather to devise and acceptable solution that will accomplish broader goals.

The Design Thinking Process formalizes a method for arriving and reasonable solutions to wicked problems.  Inside each step of the design thinking process are a number of recommendations on how to accomplish the specific step and it is the job of the designer to synthesize this information to create a good solution to a specific problem.

### Empathize

The fist step in the design thinking process is developing empathy for the user.  The word empathize is specifically chosen to highlight that this step is about more than just understanding the user.  In the design process you will be making many decisions on behalf of the user without being able to consult with the user at each step.  In order to make those decisions accurately you will need to not only understand what the user needs and wants, but you will need to under stand their motivations, background, habits, frustrations, environment, and goals.  

From a practical perspective, empathizing with he the user takes the form of engaging in user research.  This can take many forms from qualitative to quantitative research, ethnographic studies to mass market surveys.  The end goal is the same to have a good representation of the person that is going to user your product.  The only requirement is that the research should reflect each individuals humanity.

 In most organizations and for most products qualitative research is more common than quantitative research especially at the beginning of the design process.
 
 Some types of user research:
 
_Qualitative research methods_
- User Interview (By far the most common)
- Focus groups
- Shadow sessions
- Diary studies

_Quantitative research methods_
- App Analytics
- User surveys
- Mouse heatmaps
- Funnel analysis
- Cohort analysis
- A/B testing


The output of the empathize step is is usually a summary of the research presented in a way that can be regularly referred to during the design process.  The main goal is to have a set of materials that can be easily referred to during the design process in order to humanize users and inform design decisions.  This are commonly referred to as *deliverables*.

These deliverables will help you:
- Access your research quickly and regularly
- Summarize your research so others can quickly and easily understand your findings
- Cultivate empathy among stakeholders, designers, and developers by humanizing users and describing the problems and pain points they face.


There are two common formats for _deliverables_ although many different formats could be used.

#### User Personas

A user persona is a concise research based sketch of a user.  It is generally an archetype or a caricature of a typical consumer in a specific segment.  They provide a concise description of a specific type of person in a way that makes the person feel alive and real.  Because we are genetically programmed to connect with humans it is often easier for a person connect and empathize with a user persona rather than a list of relevant facts and figures.  Because of this it can help keep the user at the forefront when making design decisions.

A couple of important things to keep in mind.  Personas are powerful tools for humanizing users, but they can be easily misused.  One of the main problems is failing to remember that the user persona is simply a caricature of an actual user.  They are meant to convey information quickly, but they don't actually represent a real person and actual users will be more varied than the persona dictates.  

The second problem that I have seen with personas is that people will often fill in the blanks about the people when features are not explicitly defined.  They are especially likely to do this when the persona resembles themselves or somebody they are close too.  This leads to designers injecting too much of their own preferences, opinions, and biases into the design process at the expense of accurately representing the user.  This is especially a problem as designers are not representative of the general population of users due to a selection effect.

To avoid some of these problems it it is usually a good idea to create multiple personas for and given project.  Using multiple persona allows you to reflect the real diversity that is present in your user base.  You should also be intentional about having your personas reflect a diverse background of gender, race, age, culture, etc.
