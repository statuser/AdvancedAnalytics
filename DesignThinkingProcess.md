## An Introduction to User Experience Design

What is UX Design? - "The process of designing great digital product experiences that work well for the people who use those products."

[![What does a UX Designer Actually Do?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3zICP8XADfs/default.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3zICP8XADfs})


To summarize a UX Designer:

- Works to understand people and the problems they face related to the digital experience 
- Can identify and describe the pain points, frictions, a problems that a user experiences
- Design or redesign a product to reduce the friction and help users accomplish the task
- Design in ways that are compatible with business objectives and constraints
- Test and iterate on different design ideas to continuously improve the product or adapt to changing user and business requirements

The User Experiences designer accomplishes this by:

- Conducting, analyzing, and summarizing user research
- Meeting with stake holders to understand there priorities and constraints
- Lead workshops to create materials that will cultivate empathy toward the user and communicate insights about the customers journey
- Build wireframes and prototypes that reflect the insights and needs of users while aligning with business goals
- Test prototypes to understand how users work with their products to refine and polish the design of the products.
- Work with UI designers and developers to implement the designs consistent with their vision of the product.

One way UX designers can accomplish much of their work by following the design thinking approach.  The design thinking approach is an iterative framework that outlines specific steps to crafting user centered designs.  The process is iterative and may be non-linear as you bounce between different steps in the process or revisit earlier steps and situations and changing understanding dictate.

The steps in the Design Thinking process are:

> ### Wicked vs. Kind Problems  
> Wicked problems are problems that are complicated and varied without are real set of either rulers or well-defined outcomes.  Wicked problems do not have a clear set of inputs, lack immediate feedback, and don't have a clearly defined outcome.  In many cases a solution is judges on the "I know it when I see it!" criteria.  This is opposed to kind problems where the parameters and factors that influence a decision are clearly understood and well defined, feedback is immediate, and the rules and steps to improve are immediately clear. This does not mean that kind problems are simple or easily solved. A common example of a kind problem is the game of chess.  In chess there are approximately 10^40 positions created by legal moves and the problem is one of finding the best possible move for any given position.  This is not a simple problem, but if is still considered a nice problem since the rules and desired outcome are clear.  
> Wicked problems are the domain of design thinking.  The goal of the procedure is not necessarily to come up with the optimal solution, but rather to devise and acceptable solution that will accomplish broader goals.

The Design Thinking Process formalizes a method for arriving and reasonable solutions to wicked problems.  Inside each step of the design thinking process are a number of recommendations on how to accomplish the specific step and it is the job of the designer to synthesize this information to create a good solution to a specific problem.

## Step 1 - Empathize

The fist step in the design thinking process is developing empathy for the user.  The word empathize is specifically chosen to highlight that this step is about more than just understanding the user.  In the design process you will be making many decisions on behalf of the user without being able to consult with the user at each step.  In order to make those decisions accurately you will need to not only understand what the user needs and wants, but you will need to under stand their motivations, background, habits, frustrations, environment, and goals.  

From a practical perspective, empathizing with he the user takes the form of engaging in user research.  This can take many forms from qualitative to quantitative research, ethnographic studies to mass market surveys.  The end goal is the same to have a good representation of the person that is going to user your product.  The only requirement is that the research should reflect each individuals humanity.

 In most organizations and for most products qualitative research is more common than quantitative research especially at the beginning of the design process.
 
 Some types of user research:
 
_Qualitative research methods_
- User Interview (By far the most common)
- Focus groups
- Shadow sessions
- Diary studies

_Quantitative research methods_
- App Analytics
- User surveys
- Mouse heatmaps
- Funnel analysis
- Cohort analysis
- A/B testing


The output of the empathize step is is usually a summary of the research presented in a way that can be regularly referred to during the design process.  The main goal is to have a set of materials that can be easily referred to during the design process in order to humanize users and inform design decisions.  This are commonly referred to as *deliverables*.

These deliverables will help you:
- Access your research quickly and regularly
- Summarize your research so others can quickly and easily understand your findings
- Cultivate empathy among stakeholders, designers, and developers by humanizing users and describing the problems and pain points they face.


There are two common formats for _deliverables_ although many different formats could be used.

#### User Personas

A user persona is a concise research based sketch of a user.  It is generally an archetype or a caricature of a typical consumer in a specific segment.  They provide a concise description of a specific type of person in a way that makes the person feel alive and real.  Because we are genetically programmed to connect with humans it is often easier for a person connect and empathize with a user persona rather than a list of relevant facts and figures.  Because of this it can help keep the user at the forefront when making design decisions.

A couple of important things to keep in mind.  Personas are powerful tools for humanizing users, but they can be easily misused.  One of the main problems is failing to remember that the user persona is simply a caricature of an actual user.  They are meant to convey information quickly, but they don't actually represent a real person and actual users will be more varied than the persona dictates.  

The second problem that I have seen with personas is that people will often fill in the blanks about the people when features are not explicitly defined.  They are especially likely to do this when the persona resembles themselves or somebody they are close too.  This leads to designers injecting too much of their own preferences, opinions, and biases into the design process at the expense of accurately representing the user.  This is especially a problem as designers are not representative of the general population of users due to a selection effect.

To avoid some of these problems it it is usually a good idea to create multiple personas for and given project.  Using multiple persona allows you to reflect the real diversity that is present in your user base.  You should also be intentional about having your personas reflect a diverse background of gender, race, age, culture, etc.  

#### User Journey Maps

User Journey maps are a visual description of how users move through the journey of using the product or a part of the product.  They will capture important motivation and goals, steps that need to be completed, and identify the customers desired outcomes.  One thing to keep in mind about user journey maps is that they should begin with motivations that happen before a user interacts with the map and end after the app is closed.  This keeps the focus of the design on the user rather than simply on the app itself and opens you up to consider a wider variety of solutions to the problems that the user faces.

The main use of a customer journey map for UX designers is to understand the role the product places in a customers life and experiences.  It will provide context and background that will help the designer empathize with the customer and identify pain points, road blocks, and opportunities.

Because of the type of information a customer journey map usually contains, they are generally not used before a company has actual customers. However once a customer journey map is feasible it can be useful for many different activities in a firm including helping the CEO and executive team understand and focus on the customer, assisting marketing in understanding how to better manage the customer experience, or training front line works. 

For more details on how to create a map check out [7 Simple Steps to Build a Customer JOurney Map](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-make-customer-journey-map-with-template/)

### Exercise - Create a user persona

Using the template from CareerFoundry [Download Template](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/resources/persona_template_ux_design_careerfoundry.pdf) create a Customer Persona for our Career Search app.  

1. As a class decide on how many user personas we should create.  (Remember having more than one persona is a good idea.)
2. As a class discuss different customer segments that we would like to target.
3. Divide up in to groups of 3-4
4. Assign each group a specific target and decide on general demographics for those targets.  Doing this together will ensure that our user personas properly reflect the diversity of our target market.
5. Get together with your group and finish fleshing out the user persona.  This should take about 30-45 minutes if you work quickly.

## Step 2 - Define

The goal of the define step is to articulate the user's problem that we are intending to solve with the product we are designing.  This is very similar to defining the problem that you talked about heavily in analytics.  With wicked problems you may need to make multiple cracks at this and don't be afraid to redefine the problem multiple times as you move through the design process, receive feedback from users, and iterate on potential design solutions.  

There are a number of different techniques that we can use to define the problem. One of the most common in design circles is to define the problem as a *"How Might We..." (HMW)* question.  This is usually phrased as "How might we ..."  For example if you are interested in designing an app to help parents find educational and fun activities to do with their children you might define the problems as: "How might we assist parents on  finding a fun and educational activity to do with their young children?"  In keeping with step one, empathize, HWM questions should be customer centered and reflect customer problems rather than business constraints. 

It would also be perfectly reasonable to apply the TOSCA framework from [Cracked It: How to solve big problems and sell solutions like top strategy consultants](https://www.amazon.com/Cracked-problems-solutions-strategy-consultants/dp/3319893742/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1666215115&sr=8-2-spons).

TOSCA stands for:
- *T* - Troubles: What are the symptoms or troubles that motivated the search for a solution?
- *O* - Owner: Who is the owner of the problem? This is the person that will evaluate the solution.
- *S* - Success Criteria - How will we know that the problem is solve?  This often takes includes a time frame and will answer a question such as "Imagine it is one year from today and we are meeting again. What would the situation be like and how would be know it is time to celebrate?"
- *C* - Constraints - What are the factors that will influence the ways that the problem can be solved.  These could be things like time or monetary budgets, business goals, legal or ethical requirements, etc.
- *A* - Actors - Who are the individuals and stakeholders that are impacted by or can impact the problem.

With wicked problems, creating a problem statement is often very difficult.  The problems are often poorly understood and difficult to articulate.  The good thing is that it is not as important to have a perfect problem statement in the design thinking approach.  You will revisit your problem statement multiple times as you iterate on the design and learn more about the user, their needs, wants, and preferences.

## Step 3 - Ideate

The main objective of this step is to generate a large and diverse set of potential solutions to the problem as defined.  In the ideate phase we are shooting for quantity over quality.  At the end of the phase we will start filtering ideas to select 1-2 of our best ideas, but you should be careful to to censor or filter ideas too soon.

One of the core principles in the ideate phase is that we want to take to time to carefully examine our assumptions and intuition.  Many times the ideate phase will help you think more clearly about the research problem and solution that you have identified.  

When you are ideating you need to make sure that you separate out the process of generating ideas from filtering ideas.  If you are constantly evaluating a design to try to decide if it is a good or bad idea you will artificially censor your self and generate fewer ideas overall.  

You are familiar with many of the methods used to ideate.  The best method is going to be highly context dependent.  I often find it helpful to create a little space between defining the problem and generating ideas.  I often define problems with a notion of what the solution will be when writing the problem definition down.  This creates some bias towards the first idea being generated as being the right one.

Some methods of generating ideas:

- Brainstorming: This is exactly what you would think.  You simply list the ideas on a shared whiteboard or other workspace with everybody throwing out ideas as they occur.
- Bodystorming: This is brainstorming with a twist.  Instead of sitting around a conference table, you recreate the environment and context where the problem occurs.
- Brainwriting: This is a journaling or free writing exercise.  Similar to brainstorming, but is an individual exercise where ideas are generated individually and then shared.  It avoids some of the group think problems with brainstorming.
- Brainwalking: This is Brainwriting only you incorporate movement by placing sheets of paper strategically around the room and have individuals move from station to station, read the paper and then add ideas.  
- Mindmapping: Used during or after a brainstorming session to create a visualize the connections between different ideas.
- SCAMPER: An acronym for Substitute, Adapt, Combine, Modify, Put to other users, Eliminate, Rearrange or reverse.  This is a common industry practice when you have an existing product that you are trying to refine and improve.
- Crazy Eights: This is a sketching exercise where you rapidly sketch out eight different products.  This is most usually if the design is going to be visual like the UI of a product.  

A couple of things to keep in mind.  When ideating in a group there is a strong social bias that can interfere with the process.  The first is called social desirability bias.  People may filter thought because they are afraid of how they will be perceived by the group.  This leads to fewer ideas overall and a great idea could be missed.  The second problem is groupthink.  As social creatures humans have a tendency to change their thinking to reflect what they perceive as the dominate position of the group they are a part of.  This can greatly limit the range of ideas that can be created.  The final problem is one of participation.  In any group setting there are dominate and less dominate participants.  Group brainstorming sessions are classic cases where less dominate individuals are underrepresented.  It takes special skill to make sure that they are heard from and represented.  

One way to avoid many of these problems is to combine individual exercises with group discussion.  By starting with an individual exercise, you make sure that everybody participates without influencing each other's opinions too much.  You can then start a group brainstorming session with a foundation and a set of ideas that you can riff on.

### Exercise - Crazy 8's 

1. Select a screen from our app.  (I would recommend that you select a reporting screen since there will be many of those.)
2. Fold 1 or 2 sheets of paper into quarters.  (You will create 8 sketches total.  With one sheet of paper you will use both sides.)
3. Review your problem statement 
4. Set the time for 1-3 minutes.  In that time sketch out one idea for how that screen of your app would look.  It should be messy.  You are going to be sketching very quickly.
5. Reset and then repeat step 4 7 more times.  You should end up with 8 total sketches.  Most of them will be bad, but hopefully there are 1-2 good ideas in the mess.
6. Take a few minutes to review your ideas and select your best one or 2 to present to the class.  

The final step in the ideate process is filtering your ideas.  This is where you need to start getting critical.  Does the idea meet the objective as established in the define step?  Can it be reasonably implemented in the time and budget allocated?  Does it create additional issues or questions?  Will it delight the user?

Once you have a top 1-2 ideas we can move on the the next step...prototype.

## Step 4 - Prototype

Prototype is the process of designing an app or product that can be shown to users to receive their feedback and evaluate the usability of the design.  A prototype does not necessarily be need to be functional and is different from and MVP.  Most of the time a prototype will not be functional, but will be used to test the visual aspects of the design.  

Prototypes can be created at different levels of detail. They can be created using paper sketches or digital tools. The stage of the development process and the audience that is going to be reviewing the designs should dictate what type of prototype you create.

When speaking of prototypes we generally will be thinking about prototypes as:

- Low-fidelity
- Mid-fidelity
- High-fidelity

![Prototyping Fidelity vs. Time](https://marvel7077.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/0-9QR7NfRtWu7xTSH1.png)

For internal or personal projects Lo-fi prototypes are generally sufficient.  These are commonly made using a simple sketch on paper.  The goal of a sketch is to be able to quickly receive feedback on the major parts of a design.  You can ensure that you have included the important features and that the flow of the app makes sense and is reasonable. In many cases using a low-fidelity prototype is more useful than a higher fidelity prototype.  With a low fidelity prototype you can avoid discussions around visual design characteristics such as fonts, colors, and imagery before you are ready to address them.  The higher the fidelity of the prototype the more likely individuals are to respond to the visual elements of the design rather than the functional elements of the design.

As the process progresses or the needs of the users increase you will be moving up the prototyping scale to more detailed prototypes.  As some point you will likely want to move into digital prototypes using digital software.  You can mimic basic user interactions and quickly mock up the visual elements of a design using specialized software.  The two software products that are most commonly used right now are Figma (recently purchased by Adobe for > $20 Billion) and Adobe XD.  Both products are very similar web-based collaborative design software products like google docs.  These software products are fairly easy to use with with a mild learning curve.  If you are planning to do a lot of UX or UI design it would be worth your time investing in learning these products.  

Short/quick introduction to Figma:

These tool will let you go from a quick sketch to a nearly function design with animations, clickable buttons, and app simulations on an actual phone or web browser.  This is the closest that you can get to actually building a coded app without doing any programming.  

These tools are especially useful if you are presenting a design to a client or want to test a project with an end user.

> #### - Wireframing  
> Technically there is a difference between a prototype and a wireframe, but the difference is not important.  The terms are used interchangeably by most people.  The main difference is that with wireframing you are usually interested in the flow of an app from screen to screen while prototypes are more focused on the design features of individual pages.  Another way to think about this is that wireframes are low fidelity representations, mockups are medium fidelity representations and prototypes are high fidelity representations.  In my experience the terms are often used interchangeably and the exact definitions are not important.

[![Wireframing Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/qpH7-KFWZRI/default.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/vi/qpH7-KFWZRI)


### Exercise - Prototype your page

In the ideate phase you should have created one or two designs that you feel solve the users problem and are worth investigating further.  We are going to start with a paper sketch to make things easy.

1. Download and print the pdf file (from uiprint.co) (iPhone Prototyping Templates)[uiprint-iphone-2up.pdf]
2. Sketch a first draft of the screen that you have selected based on the ideate phase
3. Using the second template re-sketch your design to have a clean version

The reason we have two up is so that you can sketch out a first draft and then use the second template to sketch out a second draft.  This exercise should take about 10-15 minutes.

## Step 5 - Test

One of the main reasons we develop a prototype is so that we can test our design ideas with the user.  When we are testing a prototype with a user we are closing the loop on our first step of developing empathy.  In the testing phase we are ensuring that we really understand what the user needs and wants.  There are many ways to test a prototype, but they all follow the same basic flow.  Like all flows and frameworks, the steps are usually obvious and may appear unhelpful at first glance, but they provide the basic guidance so you can focus on the nuance and detail that actually matter.

Shen going through any user testing process you will need to go through the following steps:

1. *Decide what you're trying to learn or understand* - User testing should have a specific goal in mind.  This can be specific or general, but specific goals will provide specific feedback and general goals will only provide general feedback.  The problem with general feedback is that you will not have the information necessary to revise and refine the design.  The more specific that feedback you can get the better.  A few common goals are: General user acceptance, preferences for specific design elements, or ease of use of the design?
2. *Choose a test format and methodology* - Once you decide what you want to learn you need to determine the best way to learn that skill.  You could run an in-person or remote test and use a number of different testing methods.  Certain question lend themselves better to one type of testing vs. another.
3. *Figure out how you will evaluate the test* - This is going to depend on the test question and the testing methodology.  Sometimes you will have a clear winner in a test where one design is clearly superior to another.  In other situations the answer is less clear and more ambiguous.  You may have identified points of friction, but not have a clear solution revealed during the test.  This provides feedback for the next iteration of the design thinking process and should improve the empathy you have for the user.
4. *Develop the testing task* - Once you have defined the test, you need to finish designed the test itself.  This may include developing an interview script, polishing and completing prototypes, or involving developers to code the feature.
5. *Recruit and select test subjects for your task* - You need users to actually complete the task you have designed.  These users should be from your target market, and reflect the diversity of your user base. It is generally best to recruit individuals that you do not have a close personal relationship with as they will often be more objective in their feedback.  The type of test you are running will dictate the appropriate sample size. This can run the range from a small handful for user interviews to many thousands for A/B testing. This is a place where engaging and outside company for assistance is often valuable as there are a number of companies that specialize in maintaining a list of individuals willing to participate in testing activities.
6. *Run the test* - At some point you just need to do it. 🙂
7. *Analyze and Review the test results* - Once you have collected the feedback from the test you need to sit down with your team and review the results.  Build a summary of what you learned, refine your user stories, or develop plans on revising the design.  Make sure you put into action the feedback you have worked so hard to secure.

There are a few different ways of categorizing testing methodologies that are helpful to understand before discussing specific the specifics.  The first is the degree to which a test is remote vs. in-person

### Remote vs. In-person testing

In-person testing usually requires either the subject to come to a central testing facility or the tester to meet the subject at their place of work or their home.  This type of testing can be more expensive and time-consuming due to the person-to-person requirement.  This extra cost is counter balanced by the benefit of being able to control the testing environment and observe the subject while they are taking the test.  In-person tests generally yield more detailed information than a remote test  and work better when the subject pool is small and the type of information you are collecting is more general or broad based.  Some additional downsides of in-person testing are a limited subject pool in both geographic and demographic characteristics,  greater need to monetarily compensate subjects, and the need to setup a testing facility.

Remote testing on the other hand is generally cheaper to administer, allows for great subject diversity, and lower set-up costs.  The downside is that you lose control over the testing environment and don't get to observe a users reaction fully.  Think of this as the difference between an in person and a zoom class.  In some cases it could be argued that a remote test is more realistic as the context and distractions inherent in remote testing reflect the users environment when they are actually using these products, but for most usability studies finding a distraction fee environment is preferable.

### Moderated vs. Unmoderated Testing

Another dimension on which testing can very is the degree to which a test is moderated.  Moderation is the process by which a research directly watches and interacts with a subject.  The moderator is available to observe the subject, ask and answer questions, provide prompts, and probe for additional information.  Just like in-person testing, moderation can be time consuming and expensive.  Because of this it is generally reserved for sample samples sizes and in-depth testing.

Moderation is not an either/or situation, but rather a matter of degrees.  User-experience researchers vary greatly on the degree to which they insert themselves into the testing process.  Some remain actively engaged and answering questions while others try to remain neutral and just observe.  The correct level of involvement will depend on what you are trying to achieve from the test and how stuck the user gets.  Regardless, you should avoid the temptation to jump in and explain the process or the reasoning behind the design decisions.  Remember that you are trying to receive feedback from your users, not justify design decisions.

Unmoderated tests on the other extreme will often take place without a researcher present at all.  The testing procedure needs to have measurement built into the procedure and is often designed into the product as tracking metrics.  Users will often be recorded while completing the test and those recordings reviewed at a later time. For obvious reasons unmoderated tests generally need to be more formally designed and validated before they are run to ensure that they are understandable and users can complete the testing tasks.

### Common Testing methodologies

*Concept Testing*

Concept testing is a qualitative technique where you show one or more design concepts to a user and ask about their thought sand feelings about the design.  This technique is useful early in the design process before you commit to a full digital design.  Because of the qualitative nature of the task it is generally performed using moderated data collection. 

Concept testing usually takes the form of showing a prototype to a potential users and collecting feedback about the user.  You may have a script that the user is expected to walk through or use a more open ended exercise.  You will occasionally see concept testing done using an online survey.  In these cases you will present a static concept to respondents and ask for detailed feedback on the concept.  In UI Design however it is often more useful to have respondents move through a process wuth a dynamic prototype.  This way you can understand how the app fits into a customer journey.  This is difficult to accomplish using a unmoderated survey.

*A/B Testing*

A/B testing has become one of the most common testing methodology.  With A/B testing you develop a pair of concepts and focus on understanding the difference.  There are a number of ways that A/B testing can be implemented, but it is most commonly used to test small changes in existing products.  The same ideas can be used to for testing earlier design iterations however.

The basic idea of A/B testing is to divide your sample into two groups and have each group evaluate one of the concepts against a specific metric.  This is often some type of conversion metric such as signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.  You will then figure out which concepts leads to the largest improvement in the conversion metric using a statistical model.

A/B testing is almost always run as an unmoderated tests.  They generally require large sample sizes to achieve statistical significance which makes it impractical to run in person testing.  In addition, A/B testing can run into problems when you optimize for the wrong metric.  It is also often impossible to determine what caused the increase in performance if you change multiple aspects of design.  This means that you cannot use A/B testing if you do not have a high degree of confidence that the designs are stable and ready to be implmented.  

*Usability Testing*

Usability testing serves as a middle ground between concept testing and A/B testing.  With usability testing you will generally need medium to high fidelity prototypes and acess to a set of users.  The goal of usability testing is to discover how easy a given design actually is to use.

The process for creating a usability test is similar to any other kind of research.  You will need to plan the test with specific reserach questions in mind.  You tehn recruit a handful of users from a diverse background - usually at least five.  The users should come from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences.  A common mistake is to have the usability test composed of passionate expert users or absolute novices.  In both cases you will be optimizing the experiece for a specific type of user that doesn't actually reflect the real diversity of your userbase.  You should then run the tests.  Leave plenty of time in your testing procedure to fully debrief the users.  You will wnt to collect as much usable information as possible from each test.  You will finally collect and analyze the results.  You should have both qualitative and quantitative results from the test.  From here you can decide whether to iterate on the design further or move forward with building the products or implementing the tested features.
